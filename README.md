# Universal React Template with Redux

This project is a universal template for building React applications with Redux state management. It provides a solid foundation with essential features such as Suspense for lazy loading, routing setup, 404 page handling, error boundary, Emotion CSS for styling, and a pre-configured Redux store.

## Features

- **Suspense for Lazy Loading**: Utilize React Suspense to lazy load components and improve application performance by dynamically loading resources only when needed.

- **Routing Setup**: Implement React Router for declarative routing, enabling navigation between different views and pages within the application.

- **404 Page Handling**: Ensure a seamless user experience with a custom 404 page for handling routes that do not exist, providing clear feedback to users when they encounter a page not found.

- **Error Boundary**: Safeguard your application from crashing due to unexpected errors with an error boundary component that gracefully handles errors and displays a fallback UI.

- **Emotion CSS Styling**: Enhance the styling of your components with Emotion CSS, a popular CSS-in-JS library, offering a powerful and expressive way to style React components.

- **Redux Store Setup**: Configure a Redux store to manage application state, enabling predictable and centralized state management across components.

- **React Query Integration**: Seamlessly integrate React Query to handle server state and caching, simplifying data fetching and synchronization with your application's UI.

- **Useful React Hooks Library**: Incorporate a collection of useful React hooks for common tasks such as handling state, side effects, and more, streamlining your development process and enhancing code readability.

With these additional features, this universal React template becomes even more robust and versatile, providing developers with powerful tools to create modern and efficient web applications.
